# Sprint 9 acceptance harness.

#   check.sh              static checks only. No browser, no running stack.
#   check.sh --live       the static checks, then the journeys and the probes
#                         against your running stack.
#   check.sh --reuse      reuse the installed node_modules instead of running
#                         npm ci again. Faster, and it stops proving that the
#                         lock file installs.
#
# Static mode installs from the lock file, builds the production bundle, reads
# your generated clients and regenerates them from the contracts to prove they
# have not drifted, runs your unit suite and reads the names of the tests that
# ran, checks every error code in the contracts against your mapping, and greps
# the built bundle for a key, a secret and the market-data address.
#
# Live mode needs your stack up: this application served, your Trade REST API
# and your Auth service. It runs the two assessed journeys separately, plus an
# optional third where manifest.env declares one, drives your sign-in form,
# watches an unauthenticated visit to a guarded route, and records every request
# the browser makes to see where the bearer token goes. Live mode starts nothing
# and stops nothing.
#
# No workspace scaffold ships with this sprint, so every file the harness opens
# is one manifest.env names. Both modes read your names from it, so the harness
# asserts your design rather than dictating one.
#
# Passing these checks is necessary and not sufficient. Whether the messages
# your mapping produces are readable by a trader, whether the interceptor
# decides by origin rather than by a list of hosts somebody remembered, and
# whether the blotter tells a working order apart from a stalled one are
# assessed at the review.
