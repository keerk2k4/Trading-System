# Cloud week acceptance harness.
#
#   check.sh              static checks only. No network, nothing deployed.
#   check.sh --live       the static checks, then the probes against your
#                         deployed distribution and your bucket.
#
# Static mode reads manifest.env, checks the shape of the bucket name and
# distribution domain you declared, reads your deployment entry point and
# confirms it covers the build, upload and invalidate stages, and searches the
# repository for anything shaped like an AWS access key.
#
# Live mode needs the deployment to exist and needs network access. It fetches
# your distribution over HTTPS and confirms the answer is your application, it
# addresses your bucket's own endpoints and confirms they refuse, and it fetches
# the JavaScript your distribution serves and runs the Sprint 9 secret patterns
# over it. It holds no AWS credentials and asks for none: everything it checks,
# it checks from outside, the way a customer would.
#
# This harness is lighter than every harness before it, and it depends on the
# network. Most of this week happens in an account it cannot see: the origin
# access control, the IAM policy and the approval on a deploy are all read by a
# person, afterwards, from what you committed. A live failure is worth a second
# run before it is worth an hour of debugging, because a distribution that has
# just been created answers oddly until it reaches Deployed.
