# Creates the platform's Kafka topics per contracts/kafka-topics.md.
#
# Idempotent: uses --if-not-exists, so running it against a broker that
# already has the topics does nothing and exits cleanly. Safe to run on
# every compose start rather than only once.
#
# Runs inside a Kafka broker or client image, so it needs kafka-topics.sh
# on the path. Docker Compose wires this in as the kafka-init service,
# which mounts this file and runs it once the broker reports healthy. Run
# it by hand with:
#
#   docker compose exec kafka bash /kafka-scripts/create-topics.sh
#
# or, if the kafka-init service already ran and exited, rerun it directly:
#
#   docker compose run --rm kafka-init
#

# enough: nothing about a poison message needs partition-level parallelism,
# and a single partition keeps failure investigation to one ordered log.

# keeping for at least as long as its live counterpart would have been.
